        <h1>Demonstratable Outcomes</h1>
        <h2>Minimum Viable Feature 1- Facebook overlay</h2>

        <p> The overlay will provide arrows and instructions when prompted to do particular/ specific tasks of
            the focussed apps. eg. logging into facebook, messaging loved ones, posting.</p>

        <h3>Higher Level User Story</h3>
        <p> Susan opens up the Boomer Life Support app and turns on the overlay. Susan wants to write a post on
            her facebook timeline discussing the importance of wearing a mask. she selects "write a post on
            facebook". Boomer Life Support opens up Facebook and the overlay begins. An arrow points to the
            "Whats on your mind, Susan" bar and instructs her to click on it to begin writing. The overlay will
            also educate her on all the different types of things she can do with the post- she can change the
            permissions, change the background, add pictures and emojis etc. attatched is a brief example of
            what to expect.</p>

            <img src= "fbOverlay.png">


        <h2>Minimum Viable Feature 2- Gmail</h2>

        <p>An overlay of Gmail will be provided to explain to users how to navigate their emails including; viewing,
            deleting, replying, sending etc etc. our app will also educate users on how to identify red flags from
            suspicious and potentially harmful emails.</p>

        <h3>Higher Level User Story</h3>

        <p>Abe Simpson is sitting in his retirement home on his new iPad. He receives a notification from "Faceeb00k"
            telling him that his accounts been hacked and that he should click the link <"ww2w.faceeb00k.account.com
                /real/notascam"> to reset his password. Abe goes and clicks onto the link. BLS pops up and tells him
                that "this site may be harmful to you". It outlines redflags in the link and email.
                redflag 1: "Faceeb00k"
                redflag 2: ww2w
                redflag 3: "notascam"
                redlfag 4: real
                By educating Abe Simpson on the redflags, Abe could theoretically see that the site is fake and
                understand how to look for redflags in the future.</p>

        <h2>Minimum Viable Feature 3- Whatsapp</h2>

        <p>Our app provides an overlay to assist the elderly in contacting their loved ones! A major issue a lot of
            elderly people face is loneliness and not having the means or know how to contact their friends and family.
            With Covid-19 still causing most of the world to be in lockdown, our app would be especially useful at this
            moment in time. The overlay of our app will provide arrows and instructions on how to navigate whatsapp:
            calling, texting, sending attatchments etc!</p>
        <h3>Higher Level User Story</h3>

        <p>Albus Dumbledore has been feeling lonley during the summer break. He has been at home wishing he could speak
            to his family and friends. He opens up his Samsung Galaxy and goes onto whatsapp in hopes to contact
            someone. He switches to BLS once he realises that working the whatsapp application would require some magic.
            He selects to receive "help with calls on whatsapp" on BLS and it switches over to whatsapp. Arrows come up
            and show him to go to his contacts and scroll to find who he wants to call. He finds a contact and the BLS
            overlay points to the call icon to begin call. Albus presses it and within moments hes magically connected
            to his contact.</p>

        <h2>Minimum Viable Feature 4- MyGov</h2>

        <p>As we get older, it becomes more apparent that we get stuck in our old ways. Doing taxes has never been
            easier, yet some elderly people still choose to go through an accountant because 'they dont trust machines'.
            However, with our overlay, you can just place your trust in us, people who want to make you feel comfortable
            and teach you how to use the app safely and effectively.</p>

        <h3>Higher Lever User Story</h3>

        <p>George has always completed his taxes through his accountant. He has always relied on a individual and never
            technology, however, its become progressively more difficult going to his account in the time of COVID. So
            he decides that maybe this year he will do his taxes on his own, so he can get a nice tax return for his
            holiday when restrictions open up. He understands that myGov is the new app where you can place your own tax
            forms in, get centrelink payments and medicare rebates, but he doesn't know how to use as its quite
            confusing. He decides to download Boomer Life Support, and immediately sees that it has an overlay for
            myGov. Life is bliss now that he can learn how to use the app and complete his own taxes.</p>

        <h2>Minimum Viable Feature 5- Google Maps</h2>

        <p>With most elderly people in Australia having experience with the melways, they may be reliant on it to assist
            them in getting to new locations. However, the melways is a complicated book and doesnt provide live
            assistance in navigating routes. It also relies on the user to be able to remember and read street signs
            from a far. eg merging into the left lane to turn left at elizabeth street 500m ahead. This method can often
            be dangerous as the melways doesnt provide warning instructions like modren day map services do. By teaching
            the elderly how to use modern map services like google maps or waze, they can focus on driving while AI
            instructs them on directions, and also eliminates the complicated process of using a melway.</p>

        <h3>Higher Level User Story</h3>

        <p>With the outdated and complicated melways book now being outdated and replaced with online maps, Hubert J
            Farnsworth wants to try the new and more modern google maps on his mobile device. Hubert needs to deliver a
            package to an old friend and decides that today is the day he will try out google maps. He opens up BLS to
            assist him in maneuvering google maps. BLS opens up google maps and points to the search bar on the top of
            his screen. He selects it and puts in the address of his destination. Hubert is then instructed to turn on
            his location by swiping down on the notifications screen. He does so and the app begins navigating him from
            his phone.</p>
