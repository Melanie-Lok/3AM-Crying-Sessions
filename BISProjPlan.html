        <h1>Group Workload Distribution Plan</h1>
        <p>
           The workload is distributed evenly to ensure that everyone has their fair share of work. In order to establish tasks, we created a buddy system where 
           two members work together on one section of the project. By using this buddy system, we’re able to complete tasks with efficiency. 
           Furthermore, this prevents our members from feeling overwhelmed if they were to work on tasks individually. Once a team finishes their section, 
           they then assist other members with their tasks, so really, we all work together regardless. Finally, when all sections are completed, 
           we then meet up and complete the last few parts as a team, as well as discuss any notable features so we’re all on the same track.
        </p>

                <br><h5>Facebook, Emails, Whatsapp, Maps,Centrelink</h5></th>
                <td>Facebook, Emails, WhatsApp, Maps and Centrelink are applications we use on the daily, hence why it only took approximately 5 minutes to do research on these apps. 
                It was fairly simple to grasp each app's design and we already understood every function.

                    <br><h5>Facebook, Emails, Whatsapp, Maps,Centrelink</h5></th>
                <td>For each app, we had to take into account the different steps necessary in order to perform an action. 
                    Additionally, there are several different essential features which we have to include for every app. 
                    Thus, the design aspect required more time. Approximately an hour per day was spent working on the design.

                <td>Testing the prototype took no longer than 5 minutes. We each tested one MVF each and rotated, so in total, testing around 6 times to ensure the app was perfect and worked to our standard.
                    Each member was also required to get a friend or family member to test our prototype. With the feedback received, we were also able to fix and improve on our final prototype.

                <td>Understanding how to start with technologies and architecture was quite a challenge. Initially, the concept was misunderstood and a diagram of a different context was created. 
                    After consoling with our mentor, we finally figured out how to complete this task and moved on to the design.

                <th>Project Estimation Plan</th>
                <td>The estimation plan only took 15 minutes to do per task. It was quite simple to do and only required communicating with each member to complete.

                    The information we would like to present on our website would have been proofread and finalised on Google Docs. 
                    For this section, all that’s required is for each member to transfer each of their respective sections onto a HTML file, and checking over each section which should take approximately an hour. 
                    Team members with sections that require image attachments may need extra time. 
                    <br>
                    The entire website layout and design was completed by Alphonse who is our team’s coding leader, so he has spent the most time coding.

                <th>Website Construction (CSS)</th>
                <td>This section includes the layout and design elements of our website. Alphonse was responsible for HTML & CSS elements of the website, however each team member contributed to the general colour scheme of the website. 
                    This took some time to complete as Alphonse is colourblind, so we had to do a lot of discussion.

                <th>Finalising the Website</th>
                <td>Finalising the website required a significant amount of time. As a team, we went through the website together, identifying any errors such as spelling mistakes, 
                    misplacement of images, ensuring every section is completed and fixing any additional layout issues.
                    <br>
                    With the use of Github, our team leader Mitchell could easily combine each of our HTML files from our individual branches, combine everything together and finally 
                    host it on AWS.

            <dt>Microsoft Teams</dt>
            <dd>Microsoft Teams is used as our main communication platform, allowing us to meet for weekly group meetings and team catch up sessions. 
                We also meet with our mentors here.</dd>
            <dt>Visual Studio Code</dt>
            <dd>For our website, we use Visual Studio Code to code languages such as HTML and CSS.</dd>
            <dt>Figma</dt>
            <dd>Figma helped us create realistic prototypes for our team’s mobile application idea, allowing us to test our app to gather a real feel of how the app will look, run and perform.</dd>
            <dt>Google Documents</dt>
            <dd>Working in a group online can be challenging as we are unable to keep track of other team member’s progress on the assignment. Google Docs allows multiple group members to collaborate on the same document, 
                sharing ideas and helping each other out on different sections of the assignment. </dd>
            <dt>Trello</dt>
            <dd>In order to keep track of everyone’s work, set reminders, set tasks and gather a collection of resources we’ve used, Trello allowed us to stay organised and up to date.</dd>
            <dt>Google Spreadsheets</dt>
            <dd>Used for our team’s Gantt Chart and Estimation Plan Template, allowing us to keep track of our set tasks.</dd>
            <dt>Github</dt>
            <dd>Github is used to bring components of our final end product together in HTML and CSS format. Each team member contributes to their own personal branch, sharing the work they have done, which is then pulled into a master branch. </dd>
            <dt>AWS</dt>
            <dd>AWS is used to host our project idea onto a website that we have created.</dd>
