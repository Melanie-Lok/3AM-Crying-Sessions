        <h1>Resources and Tools</h1>
        <h2>Visual Studio Code <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">(link) </a> </h2>
        <p>Visual Studio Code is a free source-code editor created by microsoft, with features such as a marketplace,
            embedded gits and autocompletion of a piece of code.</p>
        <p>We decided to use Visual Studio Code because we all have used it before in previous subjects and we are
            experienced with its features.It is accessible by most operating system (Windows, Linux, and MacOS) which
            ensures that all of our members are able to access it without having to worry about the compatibility of
            their devices. The marketplace also gave us an advantage, especially with the online server and HTML
            preview, making it easier to edit our HTML files.We downloaded the latest version and the tool itself is
            free. An alternative to Visual Studio Code is notepad++ <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">(link)</a>
        </p>
        <h2>Appcelerator <a href="https://www.appcelerator.com/pricing/">(link)</a></h2>
        <p>Appcelerator is an open-source software development kit that allows for crossing/-platform mobile development
            (Android, iPhone, Blackberry, mobile web) using JavaScript as its programming language.</p>
        <p>We would be using this app because it allows for cross-platform deployment for most of the devices elders
            might have. Appcelerator has a free version with plenty of features, although they have paid versions which
            we do not require at this moment as they are more focused on mobile businesses and companies. An alternative
            could have been NetBeans. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetBeans">(link)</a></p>

        <p>We decided to use this tool since there is a built in record feature and it’s more secure (gonna explain
            later idk what to put cause they just told us we had to). We are using the current version of teams for
            free.</p>

            case we run into any issues through our development.</p>
        <p>Our group decided to use Github because we were introduced to it in our intro to IT class so we are aware of
            its features, and we are able to use it without having any issues. Most developers also use github so it is
            easy to troubleshoot any problems that we might face.</p>

            semester so we know how to handle it.</p>

        <p>We decided to use google docs because we have used it in many assignments before and by now we know how to
            use it and its features,and also because it is very easy and very simple.We can work on something all
            together at the same time and make edits without affecting someone else’s work.</p>

        <p>We use discord because as a team we think it is very easy to use and since everyone used it before hand we
            always have it opened and check messages/updates daily.Discord has a feature where you can add bots in
            servers and they can do multiple things.For example remind you for specific dates,record meetings,or even
