        <h1>WhatsApp</h1>
        <h2>Albus Dumbledore – “I want to be able to contact my friends overseas, but without paying. I've never used
          WhatsApp, is there something out there to teach me?”</h2>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p> - Old School professor</p>
        <p> - Refuses to get with the times, but is regrettably feeling the repercussions of not adapting </p>
        <p> - Loves to send messages to friends overseas through mail, but hates such long responses</p>
        <h2>Needs and Goals</h2>
        <p> - Contact friends overseas with little time delay</p>
        <p> - Be able to potentially communicate to colleagues in group formats</p>
        <p> - Learn to adapt to technological features</p>
        <h2>Skills and Experience</h2>
        <p> - Great Communicative skills</p>
        <p> - Little to no experience with technology</p>
        <h2>Context Scenario</h2>
        <p>Albus Dumbledore has always had a pen pal, as long as he can remember. He loves learning about the traditions
          and events that go on in someone else's life halfway across the world. He originally appreciated the time it
          took for his pen pals to get back to him, however, now with COVID-19 ruining air travel and delaying packages,
          he doesn't want to wait an incredibly long amount of time for a reply. His pen pal suggested he use WhatsApp
          so they can communicate more frequently in his last mail, so Albus decides to take him up on that offer.
          However, Albus has no idea how to use WhatsApp. He decides to try and use the in-app instructions but finds
          that it is difficult to understand and doesn’t provide him with enough information on how to use the app, so
          he decides to google the best way to learn how to use WhatsApp. As many have suggested with high regard,
          BoomerLifeSupport is one of the best ways to be taught about fundamentals on an app such as the likes of
          WhatsApp. Albus acknowledges this and decides to download the app BoomerLifeSupport. Albus opens up
          BoomerLifeSupport, which then links him to WhatsApp, immediately displaying an overlay on top of the app,
          encouraging him to click on features/buttons. As Albus clicks on a specific button, BoomerLifeSupport gives
          him a thorough yet simple explanation of the function. Through BoomerLifeSupport, Albus is now feeling more
          confident using the app, and decides that he can now directly message his pen pal!</p>

        <h1>Google Maps</h1>
        <h2>Hubert – “I want to be able to use google maps for the first time without having technical issues”</h2>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p> - An elderly male, lives with his wife in an outdated home, relying on habits and instinct rather than
          technology.</p>
        <p> - Loves visiting new places (loves driving)</p>

        <h2>Needs and Goals</h2>
        <p> - An easy way to find new places and locations</p>
        <p> - Quick ways to find directions on how to get to these places</p>
        <p> - Wants to replace the Melways as it doesn’t have the fastest routes due to lack of updates</p>
        <h2>Skills and Experience</h2>
        <p> - Great sense of direction</p>
        <p> - Good communication skills and can follow instructions well</p>
        <p> - Lack of experience with technology, very limited due to being frustrated easily (however, wants to learn)
        </p>
        <h2>Context Scenario</h2>
        <p>It is the beginning of the week again, Hubert’s dedicated time of the week to find a new spot him and his
          wife Stella can enjoy a nice sunset, a lookout! He seemed to have extensively looked through his Melways to
          find a new location, to much of his nobody’s surprise, it is an outdated edition and does not have any new
          locations. So, he decides to go to one of his very first lookouts in Braybrook, a place he has not been in a
          while. He noticed that there has been a lot of roadworks in Braybrook and therefore does not know any of the
          new roads and believes that it could potentially have a faster way to get to his special spot. Since Melways
          hasn’t been updated, he decides to try and use Google Maps, but isn’t too sure on how it works. He then
          realises that he has Boomer Life Support to quickly help him guide through the functions of the app! He opens
          up BLS to assist him in manoeuvring google maps. BLS opens up google maps and points to the search bar on the
          top of his screen. He selects it and puts in the address of his destination. Hubert is then instructed to turn
          on his location by swiping down on the notifications screen. He does so and the app begins navigating him from
          his phone.

        <p>As a retired nurse and previous experience in the healthcare sector, Susan finds it important to keep her
          friends updated on the importance of taking necessary precautions for COVID-19. Recently, the Victorian
          government made face masks mandatory for everyone when out in public. However, there have been anti masks
          protests and a large number of people that do not believe in the importance of face masks. Susan wants to
          write a Facebook post and keep her friends well informed about the role face masks play in helping us keep our
          statistics down. Susan opens the Facebook app on her new iPad, however there are too many features and she
          finds it hard to navigate around the app. Susan stumbles across Boomer Life Support on the AppStore and
          decides to download it. Boomer Life Support opens up Facebook and with overlay instructions, Susan is now able
          to navigate through the app. An arrow points to the "What's on your mind, Susan" bar, Susan now knows how to
          navigate and create a new post and is able to share important information with her friends.

          learning how to email his doctor. Abe opens up Boomer Life support and clicks on the outlook button, and
