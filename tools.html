        <h1>Resources and Tools</h1>
        <h2>Visual Studio Code <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">(link) </a> </h2>
        <p>Visual Studio Code is a free source-code editor created by microsoft, with features such as a marketplace, embedded gits and autocompletion of a piece of code.</p>
        <p>We decided to use Visual Studio Code because we all have used it before in previous subjects and we are experienced with its features.It is accessible by most operating system (Windows, Linux, and MacOS) which ensures that all of our members are
            able to access it without having to worry about the compatibility of their devices. The marketplace also gave us an advantage, especially with the online server and HTML preview, making it easier to edit our HTML files.We downloaded the latest
            version and the tool itself is free. An alternative to Visual Studio Code is notepad++ <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">(link)</a>
        </p>
        <h2>Appcelerator <a href="https://www.appcelerator.com/pricing/">(link)</a></h2>
        <p>Appcelerator is an open-source software development kit that allows for crossing/-platform mobile development (Android, iPhone, Blackberry, mobile web) using JavaScript as its programming language.</p>
        <p>We would be using this app because it allows for cross-platform deployment for most of the devices elders might have. Appcelerator has a free version with plenty of features, although they have paid versions which we do not require at this moment
            as they are more focused on mobile businesses and companies. An alternative could have been NetBeans. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetBeans">(link)</a></p>

        <h1>Collaborate Workspaces</h1>
        <h2>Microsoft Teams <a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a9ea252a98944440bb23bcb94c1716c06%40thread.tacv2/General?groupId=6a886672-400a-446a-8353-143c12077961&tenantId=d1323671-anscdbe-4417-b4d4-bdb24b51316b">(link)</a>
        </h2>
        <p>Microsoft Teams is a software in which people are able to communicate to each other through channels, through video calling, voice call or even through text/chat.</p>
        <p>We decided to use this tool since there is a built in record feature and it’s more secure (gonna explain later idk what to put cause they just told us we had to). We are using the current version of teams for free.
        </p>
        <P><strong>Alternative:</strong> Zoom <a href="https://zoom.us/">(link)</a> </p>

        <h2>Trello <a href="https://trello.com/b/3z8X02p1">(link)</a></h2>
        <p>Trello is a free tool for collaboration and organization of projects and helps users to keep data on boards.It helps with users to tell who is working on what part of the project and what is in progress. </p>
        <p>We use Trello to organize our project and share any important links that might be useful for our research. Trello has useful features such as checklists and labelling so each member knows what they’re working on, and figure out how long they have
            till the due date of each part of the project.</p>
        <p><strong>Alternative:</strong> Monday.com<a href="https://monday.com/">(link)</a></p>

        <h2>GitHub <a href="https://github.com/Melanie-Lok/3AM-Crying-Sessions">(link)</a></h2>
        <p>Github is a free collaborative tool that helps with the version control of our website’s development. This ensures that we are up-to-date with all our progress, and gives us a back-up of our previous versions in case we run into any issues through
            our development.</p>
        <p>Our group decided to use Github because we were introduced to it in our intro to IT class so we are aware of its features, and we are able to use it without having any issues. Most developers also use github so it is easy to troubleshoot any problems
            that we might face.</p>
        <p><strong>Alternative:</strong> Bitbucket <a href="https://bitbucket.org/product">(link)</a></p>

        <h2>AWS(Amazon Web Services) <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">(link)</a></h2>
        <p>AWS(Amazon Web Services) is a secure cloud platform where the users can store databases and host websites.It also offers compute power.</p>
        <p>We will use the latest AWS version because RMIT provided us with it for free and we also used it last semester so we know how to handle it.</p>
        <p><strong>Alternative:</strong> GoDaddy <a href="https://au.godaddy.com/hosting/web-hosting">(link)</a></p>

        <h2>Google Docs <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M6z4rxA1-ygBL7oHkDkfnElnYfD3yw-sSj-rcwiJDM4/edit">(link)</a>
        </h2>
        <p>Google Docs is a free tool that also helps the users organize their documents for a project and edit a document at the same time.They can produce many things like spreadsheets, surveys and slide presentations.
        </p>
        <p>We decided to use google docs because we have used it in many assignments before and by now we know how to use it and its features,and also because it is very easy and very simple.We can work on something all together at the same time and make
            edits without affecting someone else’s work.</p>
        <p><strong>Alternative:</strong> Microsoft Word <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/word">(link)</a></p>

        <h2>Google Sheets <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ICg6NZZE9kWygKP4TbVyk0f7gCAZ3-GPklJrfls7cc4/edit#gid=1115838130">(link)</a>
        </h2>
        <p>Google Sheets is a spreadsheet program, in which you can collaborate with other users in creating spreadsheets, through your computer or even your mobile phone.</p>
        <p>We will use Google Sheets for our Gantt chart, to keep track of our weekly progress, and the percentage of the tasks required for the submission of the project.</p>
        <p><strong>Alternative:</strong> Microsoft Excel <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel#pivot-forPersonal">(link)</a></p>

        <h2>Discord <a href="https://discord.com/new">(link)</a></h2>
        <p>Discord is a free app that was firstly created for gamers and one person would host a server and people could join and all communicate at the same time.Nowadays discord is used not only for gaming but for other many reasons as well,for example
            creating a project with a team.</p>
        <p>We use discord because as a team we think it is very easy to use and since everyone used it before hand we always have it opened and check messages/updates daily.Discord has a feature where you can add bots in servers and they can do multiple
            things.For example remind you for specific dates,record meetings,or even play music.</p>
