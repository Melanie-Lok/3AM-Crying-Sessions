            <strong>Are you smarter than a 5 year old?</strong>
            <br>No? Then you've come to the right place!

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            An app designed for elderly people/technologically inept individuals that provides assistance and instructions on how to use and operate certain key parts of their phone. EG. logging in to their emails/ downloading apps/ buying online etc. The app will
            have written instructions (similar to an IT help desk) and an overlay of their currently being used app. Eg. arrows and lines pointing out what to click.

            <br> Essentially the product will be an app that allows older users/technologically inept individuals open up an app on their phone/computer/ipad and find any information that they are wishing to find out about in regards to using their device.
            This could be something as simple as changing the font size on their phone or teaching them how to send a friend request on Facebook. Although Facebook already has a help section, what our app will incorporate is an overlay for the app. This
            overlay will help direct the user where to click, whilst giving little bits of information about thesection they are clicking on. This can either be presented through little text bubbles or through speech from one of our team.
